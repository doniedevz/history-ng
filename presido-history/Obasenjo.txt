Chief Olusegun Matthew Okikiola Ogunboye Aremu Obasanjo GCFR
Yoruba: Olúṣẹ́gun Ọbásanjọ́, born c. 5 March 1937) is a Nigerian
politician, statesman, and former army general who served as Nigeria's military dictator
from 1976 to 1979 and later as its president from 1999 to 2007. Ideologically a Nigerian
nationalist, he was a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from 1998 to 2015,
and since 2018.

Born in the village of Ibogun-Olaogun to a farming family of the Owu branch of the Yoruba,
Obasanjo was educated largely in Abeokuta, Ogun State. He joined the Nigerian Army and specialised
in engineering and served in the Congo, Britain, and India, rising to the rank of Major.
In the late 1960s, he played a major role in combating Biafran separatists during the Nigerian
Civil War, accepting their surrender in 1970. In 1975, a military coup established a junta with
Obasanjo as part of its ruling triumvirate. After the triumvirate's leader, Murtala Muhammed,
was assassinated the following year, the Supreme Military Council[3] appointed Obasanjo as Head
of State. Continuing Murtala's policies, Obasanjo oversaw budgetary cut-backs and an expansion
of access to free school education. Increasingly aligning Nigeria with the United States,
he also emphasised support for groups opposing white minority rule in southern Africa.
Committed to restoring democracy, Obasanjo oversaw the 1979 election, after which he transferred
control of Nigeria to the newly elected civilian president, Shehu Shagari.
