xGoodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan GCFR GCON (born 20 November 1957)[1] is a Nigerian politician who served as the president of Nigeria from 2010 to 2015.[2] He lost the 2015 presidential election to former military head of state General Muhammadu Buhari and was the first incumbent president in Nigerian history to lose re-election.[3]

 Previously, Jonathan served as the vice president of Nigeria from 2007 to 2010 under the administration of Umaru Musa Yar'Adua;[4] and in oil-rich Bayelsa State as governor from 2005 to 2007, and deputy governor from 1999 to 2005.[5][2]

 In 2015, Goodluck Jonathan became the first Nigerian president to concede election defeat. It allowed the transfer of power to the opposition party in Africa's biggest democracy - a country that had hitherto experienced vote-rigging and violence.[6]

 Early life and education
 Goodluck Jonathan was born on 20 November 1957 in Ogbia to a Christian Ijaw family of canoe makers,[1][7] in Otuoke, Bayelsa State.[2] His father, Lawrence Ebele Jonathan, was a canoe maker and his mother, Eunice Ayi Ebele Jonathan, was a retired farmer.[8] He attended a Christian primary and secondary school.[2]

 Jonathan received a bachelor's degree in zoology (second-class honours), a master's degree in hydrobiology and fisheries biology; and a doctorate in zoology from the University of Port Harcourt.[9][2] During his time in the university, he taught at Rivers State College of Education from 1983 to 1993.[2]

 Pre-presidency (1998â€“2010)
 Before entering into politics in 1998, Jonathan worked as an education inspector, a lecturer and an environmental-protection officer.[10] His political career began when he became involved with the nascent People's Democratic Party (PDP) in the late 1990s.[2] Jonathan entered into politics when General Sani Abacha, who ruled as military head of state of Nigeria from 1993 to 1998, died in office.

 In the 1999 Bayelsa State gubernatorial election, Diepreye Alamieyeseigha ran for governor under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party and chose Jonathan as his running mate. Alamieyeseigha won the election and became the first civilian governor of Bayelsa State in May 1999. They were reelected in 2003 and Jonathan's diligence and loyalty to him earned him the recognition as Nigeria's most hardworking deputy governor.[citation needed]
